New year, same old inting scrubs! Three new-year-hungover Int Bois are found :snowboarder:
It's the depth of winter. Being outside means freezing to death, so let's stay inside and int some games :cold_face: 
Spring is here! Time for new beginnings and new creative ways to lose in CS :clown: 
Whew, it seems we are getting good at CS! No Int-Far of the Month this month... Jk, april fools :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
It's almost summer! Days are getting longer and so are the list of games we've lost this month :eggplant: 
Summer is here, and with it comes three bright and shiny Int Bois :sun_with_face:
It's vacay season my dudes! Hit those gnarly waves and miss those easy frags :person_surfing:
It's hot outside! I'm sure getting one-tapped in CS will cool us off in no time :hot_face: 
Summer is over! It's fall, so let's *fall* into a habbit of getting destroyed in CS :poop: 
It's getting colder, the days are getting shorter, but one thing stays the same: we still can't hit our shots :sunglasses: 
It's november! The year is coming to a close, but we are still not close to being good at CS :child: 
Ho ho ho! Merry Intmas :santa: three festive Int Bois coming right up :christmas_tree:
