# Jeopardy v2.0
Add tips that appear after no one has buzzed in for a bit (if question is hard enough to warrant it).

First tip appears after 3 seconds, second tip after 8(?) seconds.

Buzz-in countdown only starts after tips are revealed (or have a countdown for each tip?)

Each tip revealed halves the value of the question.
