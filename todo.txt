--- Multi-server Int-Far ---
- Change 'user_in_game', 'active_game', 'game_start', and 'polling_active' to be a list/dict. One active game per server (or voice channel??).
- Change polling logic to reflect the above.
- Figure out what to do with active game on the website. Keep to main guild? Show multiple with a scrolling thing?
- Investigate whether 'channel_to_write' needs changing.
- Keep IFOTM and various roles to main guild.
- Add 'server_id' column to bets in databsase.
- Add option for selecting which server to tie bet to on website. Save this option in a cookie.
